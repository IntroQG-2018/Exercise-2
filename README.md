# Exercise 2: Comparing data to predictions

In this week's exercise we will work on comparing observations (data) to predictions.
In particular, we will explore two different ways in which we can compare data to a prediction:

1. Comparing individual measured values to their equivalent predicted values using a *goodness-of-fit* equation
2. Fitting a line to *x-y* data using the *least squares regression*

Both of these cases are frequently used, and can even be conducted in commonly used software such as **Microsoft Excel**.
Our goal is to understand what the numbers from these "fits" mean and how they are calculated.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.

- **Exercise 2 is due by the start of class on on 12.11.**
